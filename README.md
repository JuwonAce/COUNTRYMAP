🌍 Country Explorer

Welcome to Country Explorer, a simple yet powerful web app that allows you to explore different countries across the world. You can search for countries by name, filter them by region, and view detailed information like population, capital, languages, currencies, and more. The app even lets you toggle between light and dark modes to suit your preference. Cool, right?

🛠️ Features
Search for Countries: Start typing the name of any country in the search bar, and watch as the list updates instantly.
Filter by Region: Want to see only countries from Africa, Europe, or Asia? Use the dropdown filter to narrow down the list.
Country Details: Click on any country to see detailed information, including population, native name, languages, currencies, and even border countries.
Dark Mode: Toggle between light and dark mode to make your browsing experience more comfortable. Perfect for night owls! 🦉

🏗️ How It Works
Fetch Data from REST API: When the page loads, the app fetches data about all the countries from the REST Countries API.
Country Cards: Each country is displayed as a card with a flag and brief details like population, capital, and region.
Search & Filter: The search bar and region filter help you find countries easily. The app dynamically shows only the countries that match your query.
View Country Details: Click on a country card, and you'll be taken to a page with more in-depth information about the country, including border countries (if any).
Dark Mode: Click the 'Dark Mode' button to switch between dark and light themes.
